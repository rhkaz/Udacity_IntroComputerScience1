# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the second occurrence of 'zip'
# in text, or -1 if it does not occur
# at least twice.

# The Python code should be general enough
# to pass every possible case where 'zip'
# can occur in a string

# Here are two example test cases:
text = 'all zip files are zipped'
# >>> 18
text = 'all zip files are compressed'
# >>> -1

#text = "all zip files are zipped"

# ENTER CODE BELOW HERE
first_zip = text.find("zip")
second_zip = text.find("zip", first_zip + 1)

print (second_zip)
